{"id": "article-13494", "text": ["Pre-election violence has erupted in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, killing at least 11 people, wounding more than 100 others, and prompting several presidential candidates to suspend their campaigns. Egyptian medical and security sources confirmed the death toll in Wednesday's fighting, which began at dawn when assailants raided a protest camp occupied by hundreds of activists opposed to the military-backed government. Protesters' demands The mostly Islamist protesters had been camping near the Egyptian defense ministry in Cairo's Abbassiya district since Saturday, demanding an immediate end to military rule in Egypt. The protesters fought back against the assailants, described by some witnesses as pro-government \"thugs.\" The rival groups attacked each other with firebombs and stones. Gunfire also was heard at the scene.  ", "Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood announced a two-day suspension in solidarity with the victims. The Brotherhood also declared a boycott of a meeting with Egypt's ruling military council planned for later on Wednesday. The other leading Islamist candidate, Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, cancelled his next campaign events in protest at how authorities handled the Cairo street battles. Egypt's presidential election will be the first since a popular uprising ousted longtime autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. The military council that took over from Mubarak has promised a democratic transition and a transfer of power to an elected president by July 1. But, Egypt's generals have faced strong domestic criticism for their handling of that process, which has been plagued by periodic eruptions of deadly violence, often surrounding anti-government protests in major cities. Many of the protesters camped outside the Egyptian defense ministry are Islamists who were angered by the ruling military's decision to bar ultraconservative Islamist cleric Hazem Abu Ismail from standing in the presidential contest.

She said U.S. companies would be expected to conduct due diligence to avoid any problems, including human rights abuses.", "Despite the easing of restrictions, U.S. companies would still be barred from doing business with firms associated with the country's powerful military, and the White House announced it was keeping its framework of hard-hitting sanctions in place for now, saying Myanmar's democratic reforms are still \"nascent.\"", "The move was welcomed by two Republican senators influential on Myanmar policy, John McCain and Mitch McConnell, who both met with Wunna Maung Lwin Thursday.", "They also welcomed the nomination of Derek Mitchell, who will become the first U.S. ambassador to the country since 1990. Clinton urged his quick confirmation by the Senate. The U.S. is currently represented by a lower-level diplomat.", "Myanmar will also send a full ambassador to Washington, a post to be taken by its current permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, Than Swe.", "Human rights groups and exiled Myanmar activists criticized the announcement on the easing on economic controls.", "The U.S. Coalition for Burma said the Obama administration was prematurely rewarding Myanmar while its military was escalating violence against the Kachin ethnic minority in the north of the country. The fighting over the past year has displaced tens of thousands of villagers.", "Clinton voiced continued concern over detention of political prisoners. Western governments say hundreds of such detainees are still held despite a series of amnesties granted by Myanmar's President Thein Sein over the past year.", "The Obama administration had announced after democracy leader Suu Kyi's election in April that it planned to ease a ban on American investment that has been in place since 1997. That fueled intense debate in Washington on how and at what pace the U.S. should ease policies that have long punished Myanmar country for rights abuses and suppression of democracy.", "U.S. businesses and some lawmakers have been pushing to lift economic sanctions and point to the European Union's recent suspension of its restrictions, which could now leave American corporations at a competitive disadvantage - not least in the potentially lucrative oil, gas and mining sectors.", "Suu Kyi, who spent 15 of the previous 22 years under house arrest before her release in late 2010, this week gave cautious backing to the suspension of economic sanctions but warned that the reforms in Myanmar were still reversible.", "Human Rights Watch is demanding the imposition of binding rules on corporate responsibility for U.S. companies working in Myanmar and revision of a blacklist of sanctioned Myanmar entities - which U.S. officials say is underway. Many of them, both individuals and companies, are linked to the military, and U.S. firms will still be barred from working with those entities.", "A senior administration official said the U.S. government would develop a mechanism to ensure transparency and oversight in American business dealings in Myanmar, but the standards would not be legally binding.", "The official, who was briefing reporters on condition of anonymity to provide details of the new U.S. policies, also cautioned that Myanmar was not currently a very welcoming place for foreign businesses, because of the human rights situation, corruption and the rudimentary legal and regulatory environment.", ""], "events": [{"id": 1, "mention": "declared", "sent_id": 0, "offset": [35, 43]}, {"id": 2, "mention": "easing",

The attack, which came minutes after witnesses said regime forces gunned down mourners at a funeral procession nearby, dealt a fresh blow to international envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan.", "Activists said the violence continued Wednesday with regime forces opening fire from the outskirts of Khan Sheikhoun.", "Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights activist group, said the heavy machine-gun fire has so far prevented people from holding funerals for some of the 20 mourners who were killed at the funeral a day earlier.", "The U.N. said rebel forces had given the observers shelter in the town, which has witnessed anti-government protests since an uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in March last year.", "Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the U.N. team, told reporters Wednesday that he had spoken with the observers in Khan Sheikhoun by telephone and that they \"told us that they are happy and safe where they are.\"", "Ahmad Fawzi, Annan's spokesman, said in a statement that the mission will recover the six staff members later Wednesday. \"The U.N. staff members are co-located with opposition elements ... and are reportedly being treated well.\"", "Fawzi said the observers were caught up in the explosion as they met with the rebel Free Syrian Army.

The video shows two white vehicles clearly marked \"U.N\" with people milling around it, and two others parked a few meters (yards) behind. Slippers apparently left behind by the mourners running away from the shooting earlier are seen strewn about on the ground.", "The blast blew off the front of the first vehicle and sent up a plume of smoke as people screamed and frantically ran for cover. The four cars are then seen slowly driving away.", "It was not clear how close the observers were to the funeral shootings, but if confirmed, a regime attack on civilians directly in front of the observer mission could put pressure on them to describe publicly what they are seeing in Syria. They report back to the U.N. but have not publicized their findings.", "Syria's state-run TV, meanwhile, reported Wednesday that authorities released 250 people who were involved in the uprising. Assad has issued several pardons releasing thousands of detainees since the crisis began.", "The Observatory also said Syrian forces opened fire at the Naziheen Palestinian refugee camp in the southern city of Daraa, killing four people.
