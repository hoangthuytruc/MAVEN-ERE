Protesters' demands The mostly Islamist protesters had been camping near the Egyptian defense ministry in Cairo's Abbassiya district since Saturday, demanding an immediate end to military rule in Egypt.

Egypt's presidential election will be the first since a popular uprising ousted longtime autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. The military council that took over from Mubarak has promised a democratic transition and a transfer of power to an elected president by July 1. But, Egypt's generals have faced strong domestic criticism for their handling of that process, which has been plagued by periodic eruptions of deadly violence, often surrounding anti-government protests in major cities. Many of the protesters camped outside the Egyptian defense ministry are Islamists who were angered by the ruling military's decision to bar ultraconservative Islamist cleric Hazem Abu Ismail from standing in the presidential contest.
